# My-project-euler-solutions
pyhton3 implementation of project euler problems. These may not always be optimised but are mathematically rigorous. Before each problem
I study the maths behind the question.
Some of the maths that I have come across and really liked - 
1) Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find prime numbers upto a limit (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes)
2) Millerâ€“Rabin primality test (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller%E2%80%93Rabin_primality_test)
3) RSA algorithm for encryption and decryption (https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_algorithm)
